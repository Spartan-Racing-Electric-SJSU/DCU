# DCU
The Dash Control Unit repository for configuring the CAN protocol and LCD configuration for displaying messages onto the dash  

Consider including the CAN and LED libraries into your Arduino libraries `Program Files/Arduino/lib`  

You may need to update your `LiquidCrystal_I2C` library to the new one if you have compile issues with avrdude
